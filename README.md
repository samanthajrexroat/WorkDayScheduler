## Functionality
* When the browser is loaded, the current day is displayed at the top of the page.

* The user is presented with time blocks for the standard work day: 9 AM - 5 PM.

* Each time block's color represents whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).

* The user can enter text in each time block and click the save button to the right to store the entered text.

* The user input is then saved to local storage and will persist on the page even if it is reloaded.
